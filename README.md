## üìê Design Approach

My portfolio emphasizes clarity and user experience. Here‚Äôs what I focused on:

- **Component-Specific Animations:** Only animating elements when they appear in view, avoiding unnecessary repetition.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** Contact lines and footer adapt based on screen size; vertical on small screens, horizontal on larger screens.
- **Attention to Details:** Gradients, shadows, typography, and spacing were carefully chosen to create a modern and professional feel.
